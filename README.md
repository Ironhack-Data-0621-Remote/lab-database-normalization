Lab: Database normalisation

This schema is for a modified version of the Sakila database.

I have modified the table slightly to represent a version of Sakila which is for an online film rental service only available in Germany.

I have removed the following tables:

- Country
- Inventory
- Store
- Staff

These are no longer necessary as my version of Sakila has no physical stores and is only available in one country :)

I kept the remaining keys and relationships the same as the previous Sakila schema.
